## Overview

Each script in this repository demonstrates how to:
1. Prompt the user for two numbers.
2. Divide the first number by the second.
3. Display the result or handle errors, such as division by zero.

## Languages Covered

The following languages are represented in this repository:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C
- C++
- C#
- Swift
- more languages yet to come

## Usage

To run these scripts:
1. Ensure you have the required environment or compiler for each language.
2. Copy and paste the code from the appropriate file into your development environment.
3. Run the script and follow the prompts to input two numbers.

Each program checks for division by zero, providing an error message if the second input is zero.
